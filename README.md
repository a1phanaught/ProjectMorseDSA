# ProjectMorseDSA
ProjectMorseDSA is a coding project done by me as part of a Data Structure And Algorithm course for Diploma in Computer Science at UTMKL

The program was written in C++ mostly with Visual Studio Code using mingw64 compiler version 8.1.0

If you want to use Dev C++, refer to this link to change your compiler options: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16951376/how-to-change-mode-from-c98-mode-in-dev-c-to-a-mode-that-supports-c0x-ran

So how does this program works? Basically we are using a binary tree to store the letters and symbols according to the description shown in AboutMorseCode.png. As users entered the morse code, the code will traverse through the tree until it gets a letter or symbol. This concept was first proposed by Berk Ozer in an article written by him ( https://medium.com/swlh/how-tree-data-structures-help-us-understand-morse-code-a95f6f7f2219 ).

Huge thanks to our lecturer, Ms Rokiah Binti Bahari, who has taught me the concept of Data Structures and Algorithms.
